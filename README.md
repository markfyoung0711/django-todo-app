# dockerize - django dockerization for consistent development.

props to https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-python/dockerize-django/
realpython had a dockerization course but it is from 2015 and does not use django
i ran into issues with invoking the manage.py when container was being run (as I'm also learning
docker) and had issues with that.
